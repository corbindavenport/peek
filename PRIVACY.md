# Privacy Policy

Peek iself does not collect any user data. However, Peek does load external content in previews, which may collect data through network requests to the original server, or code loaded through the embedded preview. Peek tries to limit this behavior as much as possible by using your browser's own preview and embed functionality, and loading most other content in [sandboxed IFrames](https://web.dev/sandboxed-iframes/).

Content loaded in dynamic embeds are subject to the terms of service and privacy policies of the content's source, such as:

- [Imgur Terms of Service](https://imgur.com/tos) & [Imgur Privacy Policy](https://imgur.com/privacy?forcedesktop=1), for Imgur link previews
