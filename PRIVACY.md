# Privacy Policy for Peek

Peek is committed to respecting your privacy and being transparent about the collected data. This policy outlines what information is transmitted during the installation and use of Peek, how it is used, and how you can control the collection.

## Information collected by Peek

Peek stores your server list and other settings in your web browser. That data may be synchronized to your other devices through your web browser's cloud account (e.g. a Firefox Account in Firefox). The extension itself does not transmit any other information about you or your device.

Peek does load external content in previews, which may collect data through network requests to the original server, or code loaded through the embedded preview. Peek tries to limit this behavior as much as possible by using your browser's own preview and embed functionality, and loading most other content in [sandboxed IFrames](https://web.dev/sandboxed-iframes/).

Content loaded in dynamic embeds are subject to the terms of service and privacy policies of the content's source, such as:

- [YouTube Privacy Policy](http://help.youtube.com/policies/privacy/) & [YouTube Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms), for previews of YouTube videos
- [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement) & [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement), for the Office Online Viewer (used for some MS Office file previews, OpenDocument previews, etc.)
- [Imgur Terms of Service](https://imgur.com/tos) & [Imgur Privacy Policy](https://imgur.com/privacy?forcedesktop=1), for Imgur link previews
- [TikTok Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-use?lang=en) & [TikTok Privacy Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy?lang=en), for TikTok video previews
- [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US), for previews of MS Office files, Gooogle Docs links, etc.
